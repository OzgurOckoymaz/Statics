# Statics

1) Create a math class (static) and define a function method that finds the sum of two numbers (static)
2) Create a math normal class and create addition (normal) and subtraction (static) function methods.
3) Create a static class called constants. Let's define constants inside;

• public const double VAT = 0.18;
• public const int WiseAdam_FirmaCode = 10000;
• public static string Institution = "Apple";
• public static string AdminRolName = "MasterUser"
• public static readonly double GravityCoefficient = 9.8;

4) Define a static extensionMethod class. Let's define a static function method in a string data type named “clearTurkishChar”. 

5) And finally, add 5 buttons;

1) On the 1st button: Let's enter a price, calculate the VAT and show us the sales price.
2) On the 2nd button: Bring the name of the institution
3) On the button: Enter 2 numbers, print the sum from the static math class
   Print sum and difference from regular math class
4) On the button: If the company is Apple, 30%, if another company makes a 5% discount.
5) On the button: Let's create a random text and send it to the clean method.
